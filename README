    1. All boolean functions that check if a user can perform an action are tested with the rules for Booleans in Boundary Value Analysis.
    
    2. All counts (hand size, deck size, card inclusions) are tested with the rules for Counts in Boundary Value Analysis.
    
    3. All intervals (See The Future, Pairs, Three of a Kinds, Five of a Kinds, putting cards into the deck) are tested with the rules for Intervals in Boundary Value Analysis.
    
    4. All strings (Card identifiers) are tested with the rules for Strings in Boundary Value Analysis.

    6. Selection of elements in a collection (players hands) are tested with the rules for Using an Element of a Sequencable Collection in Boundary Value Analysis.
    
    7. Subsets of collections (Pairs, Three of a Kinds, Five of a Kinds) are tested with the rules for Using a Subset of a Collection in Boundary Value Analysis.
    
    8. All pairs of counts and intervals are tested with the rules for Pairs of Counts/Intervals in Boundary Value Analysis
    
    9. All pairs of collections (players' hands) are tested with the rules for Pairs of Collections in Boundary Value Analysis.
